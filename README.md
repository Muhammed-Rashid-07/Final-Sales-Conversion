## Project Description

In this project we are going to create an end to end sales conversion prediction model using kedro, mlflow, evidently, and streamlit

We use kedro as workflow orchestrator and mlflow for experiment tracking, evidently AI for monitoring and streamlit for creating web application. By using this technologies will help us to build a robust Sales Conversion prediction Model.
